## Insights & Findings:
- The chart shows a higher concentration of ratings for TV-MA (Matured Audience Only shows) with a count of 3,207 compared to NC-17 (Not for Children Under 17) shows at a count of 3. This implies that Netflix offers more content targeted towards mature audiences compared to content restricted to viewers above 17.
- Increase in Content Over Time: The graph shows a general upward trend in the number of movies and TV shows added to Netflix over the years from 2011 to 2021. This suggests that Netflix has been consistently adding new content to its library.
- More Movies than TV Shows: Movies have consistently held a dominant position in the entertainment industry, surpassing the production of TV shows year after year.
- Drama dominates: Dramas appear in a significant number of the top categories, suggesting they're a popular choice for viewers.
